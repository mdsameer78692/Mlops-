Documenting tasks, progress, and learnings."
🔹 DevOps
What it is: A set of practices that combine Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops).
Goal: To deliver software faster, more reliable, and automated.
Focus areas:

Automating code builds, testing, and deployments (CI/CD).

Infrastructure as code (managing servers, containers, cloud).

Monitoring applications in production.

👉 Example: You build a web app → DevOps makes sure it’s tested, deployed, scaled, and monitored smoothly.

🔹 MLOps

What it is: A specialized extension of DevOps, but for Machine Learning (ML) projects.

Goal: To deliver machine learning models into production reliably and keep them updated.

Focus areas:

Data pipelines (collecting, cleaning, and preparing data).

Model training and versioning (tracking experiments, hyperparameters).

Deployment of ML models (serving predictions in real-world apps).

Monitoring model performance (detecting drift, retraining when accuracy drops).

👉 Example: You build a fraud detection model → MLOps makes sure the model is trained, deployed, monitored, and retrained when fraud patterns change.

🔑 Main Difference in One Line

DevOps = Focus on software delivery lifecycle (code → deployment → monitoring).

MLOps = Focus on ML model lifecycle (data → training → deployment → monitoring → retraining).
