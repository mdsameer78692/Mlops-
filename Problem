List 5 real-world problems that MLOps helps solve (e.g., model drift, reproducibility)
1. Model Drift (Data/Concept Drift)

Problem: A modelâ€™s accuracy drops over time because real-world data changes (e.g., fraud patterns, customer behavior, or market trends).

MLOps Solution: Monitors models in production, detects drift, and automates retraining with updated data.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Reproducibility of Experiments

Problem: Data scientists run many experiments (different datasets, hyperparameters, or algorithms), but without proper tracking, itâ€™s hard to reproduce results later.

MLOps Solution: Tracks datasets, code, models, and parameters (using tools like MLflow, DVC, or Weights & Biases). Ensures results can be reproduced anytime.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Scalable Deployment of Models

Problem: A model that works in a Jupyter notebook may fail under real-world load (e.g., millions of users making predictions).

MLOps Solution: Provides pipelines for scalable model deployment (via Docker, Kubernetes, cloud services) so models can serve predictions reliably.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Collaboration Between Teams

Problem: Data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps teams often work in silos. Code, data, and infrastructure donâ€™t sync properly.

MLOps Solution: Standardizes workflows (CI/CD + Continuous Training), making it easier for teams to share datasets, models, and deployment pipelines.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Monitoring & Governance

Problem: Unlike normal software, ML models can silently fail (e.g., biased predictions, poor accuracy, or compliance issues).

MLOps Solution: Adds monitoring for prediction quality, fairness, latency, and compliance. Keeps models accountable and auditable.
